                Here we have a staple of our town. You may want to checkout The Dog Park when you arrive to Night Vale.
                Or maybe just be near it and in its presence. Since you shouldn't look at The Dog Park or its Hooded
                Figures. You are also not allowed in The Dog Park, nor are dogs. So bask in its presence and hope it doesn't let you in, for you may just disappear. <br><br> The Hooded Figures do like cats, according from outside
                sources though! </p>

                The museum loves to be involved with the town, occasionally holding talks from technology experts,
                including members of the community. Speakers are required to swathe themselves in burlap, and the museum
                uses a white noise generator to prevent anyone from hearing.</p>

                When you come down, you <b><i>need</i></b> to try Big Riko's Pizza! No really! It's illegal not to do so once a week, or it's a misdemeanor. <br><br>Big Rico's Pizza is the only pizzeria that hasn't been burnt down in
                an unolved arson case, making it extra special! It has recently upgraded to include more family friendly
                experiences, such as including a ball pit, a snake pit, a ball pit with snakes, Whack-a-Mole, and The
                Table Scraps. <br><br>You'll love The Table Scraps! The Table Scraps are an animatronic band made up of three
                members: Rodney Rat (vocals), Pasha Possum (guitar), and Chrissy Cockroach (percussion). Absolutely
                perfect to comfort the cockroach running your heart, it works really hard, you should reward it.

                Oh this ones great! There's about a 25 feet tall obelisk that radiates a soft blue light, it's "oily and
                soft like a fresh brick of parmesan cheese". The obelisk moves around, disappearing and reappearing
                whenever it pleases. <br><br> It is a Night Vale tradition amongst its citizens to carve their names onto one of
                its four sides. Whenever it appears - the carvings disappear when the obelisk goes away and when it
                comes back, the ritual begins again, join us in it. Funnily enough, it makes a lot of noise, sounding "like a Bach concerto played by a French Horn and a Theremin from inside a refrigerator". <br><br>And if it doesn't get better, it's mesmerizing
                existence attracts many cats, so maybe hope its around for a visit just for that. <br> <br>
                Or maybe you should hope it's here to be potentially chosen to have the opportunity to have any question
                to be answered, no matter how implausible. Be careful.

            <p>This is where all the magic happens! -- Of course magic isn't real and you should report to the secret police if you start thinking it is -- This is the place where Cecil Palmer tells us the news and lets us know if we arw doing things right. <br> <br> It's a perfect place to come by and visit - maybe even intern - if you're a fan of our news. <br> <br> Let us give you an idea on what the place looks like! <br> <br>It's a messy home and is full of hallways winding away into a labyrinth of audio equipment and tape stacks, with windows that look out onto empty recording studios that haven't been used in decades, but that still broadcast live shows every night. Cecil also has mentioned that there are a nest of owls in the corner, like any normal radio station. <br> <br> And just in case you were worried about your safety, the station doors are carved from reclaimed bloodstone using ancient wisdom lost along with the station architects in 1942. They can only be opened by bleeding on them. And as Cecil says, "That's just part of having a good security system."</p>

Others the most fearsome creature imaginable it cannot be described. <br><br> As some lucky news, the library has received drinking fountains, dunking chambers, a fainting pool, librarian repellent dispensers, and beanbag chairs. </p>
